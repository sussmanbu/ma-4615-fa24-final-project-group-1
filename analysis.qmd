## Motivation for Data Analysis

Traffic accidents arise from a complex interplay of factors, including infrastructure quality, environmental conditions, and driver behavior. One of the key variables of interest is the Pavement Condition Index (PCI), which quantifies pavement quality. While one might suspect that deteriorating pavement conditions could contribute to higher accident counts, the strength and nature of this relationship remain unclear. In addition, other factors—such as weather and surface conditions—may interact with PCI in ways that either amplify or mitigate its influence on accidents.

## Questions We Aim to Answer

In this data analysis, our goal is to explore the impact of PCI (Pavement Condition Index) on the number of traffic accidents and assess the role of weather conditions (Weather) and surface conditions (Surface Condition) in this relationship. By constructing various regression models, including linear and polynomial models, we analyze whether the relationship between PCI and accident count is significant and whether it exhibits nonlinear trends. Additionally, we consider the effects of weather and surface conditions on accident count to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issue. The specific questions to address are as follows:

- How does the variation in PCI affect the number of traffic accidents? Is there a significant relationship between the two?
- Is the relationship between PCI and accident count linear or nonlinear? Can a polynomial model capture more complex patterns?
- How do weather conditions (Weather) and surface conditions (Surface Condition) influence the relationship between PCI and accident count? Do they have a significant impact on the number of accidents?

## Context and Illustrations for the Analysis

After cleaning and merging the crash and roadway data, an initial exploratory analysis was conducted. One of the first steps was to visualize the relationship between PCI and accident count. The scatterplot below shows accident count versus PCI with a fitted trend line:

The plot reveals a slight negative correlation between PCI and accident count, but the overall impact appears weak. The trend line is relatively flat, and the data points are highly scattered. This result suggests that PCI alone has limited explanatory power for accident count, indicating that other factors may have a greater influence, which will be a key consideration in the model-building process.

## Modeling and Inference

### Formal Statistical Modeling Framework

To analyze the relationship between PCI and accident count, we began with a simple linear regression model:

$$
\text{Accidents} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{PCI}) + \varepsilon.
$$

However, the distribution of accident counts was skewed and included outliers. To address this, we applied a log-plus-one transformation:

$$
\log(1 + \text{Accidents}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{PCI}) + \varepsilon.
$$

This transformation reduced the impact of outliers and brought the residuals closer to normality. Next, we incorporated weather and surface condition variables into the model:

$$
\log(1 + \text{Accidents}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{PCI}) + \beta_2(\text{Weather}) + \beta_3(\text{Surface.Condition}) + \varepsilon.
$$

Finally, to explore potential nonlinear relationships, a quadratic term for PCI was introduced:

$$
\log(1 + \text{Accidents}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{PCI}) + \beta_2(\text{PCI}^2) + \beta_3(\text{Weather}) + \beta_4(\text{Surface.Condition}) + \varepsilon.
$$

## Ideas and Techniques for Choosing Predictors

In the simple regression analysis, we noticed that the distribution of accident counts exhibited significant variability and outliers, which could negatively affect model fitting and result interpretation. To address this, We applied a logarithmic transformation (log1p) to the accident count data to reduce the impact of outliers, resulting in a smoother and closer-to-normal distribution.

In the linear regression analysis, we found that the linear relationship between PCI (Pavement Condition Index) and accident count was weak. The trend line was relatively flat, and the model's goodness of fit was low, with an adjusted R² of only about 4.2%. This indicates that the linear model might not adequately capture the complexity of the relationship. Additionally, the data distribution suggested that the changes in accident counts across different PCI ranges might not follow a simple linear pattern, showing some nonlinear characteristics. To better capture this, We introduced a quadratic polynomial term for PCI (poly(PCI, 2)) to construct a nonlinear regression model. This approach modeled both first-order and second-order effects, revealing a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped trend in the influence of PCI on accident counts.

## Modeling Results

**Univariate Linear Regression**

The results of the univariate linear regression indicate a weak negative correlation between PCI (Pavement Condition Index) and accident count, with a slope of -0.037, which is statistically significant (p-value < 0.001). However, the model's explanatory power is extremely low, with an R² of only 0.0043, meaning PCI accounts for just 0.43% of the variation in accident count. Additionally, the residual standard error is high (8.019), reflecting a substantial prediction error. While the overall model is statistically significant (F-statistic p-value < 0.001), its practical impact is minimal, suggesting the need for additional variables or nonlinear methods to improve explanatory power.

After applying a logarithmic transformation to accident counts, the impact of outliers was reduced, but the relationship between PCI and the log-transformed accident count remained very weak. Scatterplots and linear regression trend lines showed almost no noticeable linear association, with the trend line being nearly flat, indicating that PCI has a limited influence on accident count.

Here is the visualization:

**Multivariate Regression with Weather and Surface Conditions**

The multivariate regression results revealed a significant negative correlation between PCI and accident count (coefficient: -0.0355), suggesting that better pavement conditions are associated with slightly fewer accidents. Weather and surface conditions also had significant effects on accident count. For instance, wet surfaces significantly increased accident counts, while rainy weather was associated with fewer accidents, potentially because drivers exercised more caution. Despite the statistical significance of these variables, the model's goodness of fit remained low, with an adjusted R² of only 4.2%, indicating that accident count is likely influenced by many other unaccounted factors.

**Nonlinear Regression with PCI Quadratic Term**

The nonlinear regression results indicate that by including the quadratic polynomial term for PCI (poly(PCI, 2)), the nonlinear relationship between PCI and accident count was captured. The negative coefficient of the first-order term (-52.66172) and the positive coefficient of the second-order term (34.10442) suggest that the effect of PCI on accident count exhibits a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped trend, where accident count initially increases slightly with PCI and then decreases. Additionally, the significance and directionality of weather and surface conditions remain consistent; for example, rainy weather (WeatherRAINING) significantly reduces accident counts, while wet surfaces (Surface.ConditionWATER) significantly increase them.

Although the model's goodness of fit improved slightly (adjusted R² = 4.4%), and the residual standard error (7.857) showed minor improvement, these findings suggest that while the model captures some complexity, accident count is still heavily influenced by other unmodeled factors.

However, it is important to note some uncertainty in our estimates and conclusions. On one hand, while the coefficients are statistically significant, the model's fit remains low, indicating that these variables explain only a small portion of the variation in accident count. On the other hand, the scattered data distribution may make the results particularly sensitive to extreme values or low-frequency categories, which can affect the magnitude and direction of coefficients. Furthermore, the nonlinear relationship between PCI and accident count, such as the U-shaped or inverted U-shaped trend, might depend on sample characteristics and data distribution, requiring further validation and analysis to draw more reliable conclusions.

## Additional Insights from Highway Mileage Data

To further contextualize these results, we examined crash distribution data from a highway mileage dataset. This supplementary visualization shows the total number of crashes across various route types and under different surface conditions:

![](images/Crash-Distribution-by-Route-Type-and-Surface-Condition.png)

In these stacked bars, DRY conditions dominate most crashes, regardless of route type or year. While one might expect poor pavement or inclement conditions to drive up accidents substantially, the figure reveals that even under primarily dry conditions, crashes are frequent. Interstates and state highways often show higher totals, likely reflecting greater traffic volume and speed. This suggests that while pavement condition and certain environmental factors influence accidents, the broader context—such as traffic exposure (vehicle miles traveled), route type, and usage patterns—can overshadow more subtle effects of PCI alone.

## Limitations

When analyzing the relationship between PCI (Pavement Condition Index) and accident count, it is important to consider certain assumptions and data limitations. The current model assumes a simple linear or nonlinear relationship between PCI and accident count, but the actual situation may be more complex. Additionally, accident counts may be influenced by temporal or spatial factors.

The model's fit is not ideal, indicating that other significant factors (such as traffic volume, speed limits, or time of day) might have a greater impact on accident count. Moreover, the data distribution is quite dispersed, and some extreme values or low-frequency categories could significantly affect the results.

Data limitations also introduce uncertainty. The distribution of accident counts is highly scattered, and extreme values or rare categories (like certain surface conditions) may skew the results. The nonlinear relationship and the influence of weather and surface conditions may depend on sample characteristics or localized traffic patterns not accounted for here.

Future research could incorporate richer variables—such as detailed traffic volume metrics, time-of-day effects, driver demographics, and enforcement intensity—to better understand the multifaceted nature of traffic accidents. More sophisticated models and data sources might eventually tease out subtler influences of pavement quality and other environmental factors on roadway safety.

## Conclusion

This analysis suggests that while PCI shows a statistically significant relationship with accident counts, its effect is weak and overshadowed by other factors. Even when accounting for weather and surface conditions, and allowing for nonlinear patterns, the explanatory power remains modest. The supplementary highway mileage visualization reinforces the notion that fundamental aspects like traffic volume, route usage, and driver behavior likely play more critical roles.

In summary, PCI is not a strong standalone predictor of accident frequency, and a more holistic, data-rich approach is needed to fully understand and mitigate traffic accidents.
