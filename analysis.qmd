Motivation for Data Analysis

One of the topics we are most interested in is the relationship between PCI (Pavement Condition Index) and accident count. By analyzing these variables, we aim to understand the potential impact of pavement conditions on accidents and determine whether there are significant linear or nonlinear patterns.

Questions We Aim to Answer

In this data analysis, our goal is to explore the impact of PCI (Pavement Condition Index) on the number of traffic accidents and assess the role of weather conditions (Weather) and surface conditions (Surface Condition) in this relationship. By constructing various regression models, including linear and polynomial models, we analyze whether the relationship between PCI and accident count is significant and whether it exhibits nonlinear trends. Additionally, we consider the effects of weather and surface conditions on accident count to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issue. The specific questions to address are as follows:

  How does the variation in PCI affect the number of traffic accidents? Is there a significant relationship between the two?
  Is the relationship between PCI and accident count linear or nonlinear? Can a polynomial model capture more complex patterns?
  How do weather conditions (Weather) and surface conditions (Surface Condition) influence the relationship between PCI and accident count? Do they have a significant impact on the number of accidents?


Context and Illustrations for the Analysis

After data cleaning and merging, we conducted an initial exploration of the variables and plotted a scatterplot with a trend line to examine the relationship between PCI and accident count. Here is the visualization:


The plot reveals a slight negative correlation between PCI and accident count, but the overall impact appears weak. The trend line is relatively flat, and the data points are highly scattered. This result suggests that PCI alone has limited explanatory power for accident count, indicating that other factors may have a greater influence, which will be a key consideration in the model-building process.



Modeling and Inference

Formal Statistical Modeling Framework

To analyze the relationship between PCI and accident count, We first constructed a simple linear regression model and visualized the trend between the two variables. Next, We developed a multiple linear regression model by incorporating Weather (weather conditions) and Surface.Condition (surface conditions) as additional predictors.





Ideas and Techniques for Choosing Predictors

In the simple regression analysis, We noticed that the distribution of accident counts exhibited significant variability and outliers, which could negatively affect model fitting and result interpretation. To address this, We applied a logarithmic transformation (log1p) to the accident count data to reduce the impact of outliers, resulting in a smoother and closer-to-normal distribution.

In the linear regression analysis, We found that the linear relationship between PCI (Pavement Condition Index) and accident count was weak. The trend line was relatively flat, and the model's goodness of fit was low, with an adjusted R² of only about 4.2%. This indicates that the linear model might not adequately capture the complexity of the relationship. Additionally, the data distribution suggested that the changes in accident counts across different PCI ranges might not follow a simple linear pattern, showing some nonlinear characteristics. To better capture this, We introduced a quadratic polynomial term for PCI (poly(PCI, 2)) to construct a nonlinear regression model. This approach modeled both first-order and second-order effects, revealing a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped trend in the influence of PCI on accident counts.


Modeling Results

The results of the univariate linear regression indicate a weak negative correlation between PCI (Pavement Condition Index) and accident count, with a slope of -0.037, which is statistically significant (p-value < 0.001). However, the model's explanatory power is extremely low, with an R² of only 0.0043, meaning PCI accounts for just 0.43% of the variation in accident count. Additionally, the residual standard error is high (8.019), reflecting a substantial prediction error. While the overall model is statistically significant (F-statistic p-value < 0.001), its practical impact is minimal, suggesting the need for additional variables or nonlinear methods to improve explanatory power.
Here is the visualization:

After applying a logarithmic transformation to accident counts, the impact of outliers was reduced, but the relationship between PCI and the log-transformed accident count remained very weak. Scatterplots and linear regression trend lines showed almost no noticeable linear association, with the trend line being nearly flat, indicating that PCI has a limited influence on accident count.
Here is the visualization:

The multivariate regression results revealed a significant negative correlation between PCI and accident count (coefficient: -0.0355), suggesting that better pavement conditions are associated with slightly fewer accidents. Weather and surface conditions also had significant effects on accident count. For instance, wet surfaces significantly increased accident counts, while rainy weather was associated with fewer accidents, potentially because drivers exercised more caution. Despite the statistical significance of these variables, the model's goodness of fit remained low, with an adjusted R² of only 4.2%, indicating that accident count is likely influenced by many other unaccounted factors.
Here is the visualization:

The nonlinear regression results indicate that by including the quadratic polynomial term for PCI (poly(PCI, 2)), the nonlinear relationship between PCI and accident count was captured. The negative coefficient of the first-order term (-52.66172) and the positive coefficient of the second-order term (34.10442) suggest that the effect of PCI on accident count exhibits a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped trend, where accident count initially increases slightly with PCI and then decreases. Additionally, the significance and directionality of weather and surface conditions remain consistent; for example, rainy weather (WeatherRAINING) significantly reduces accident counts, while wet surfaces (Surface.ConditionWATER) significantly increase them.
Here is the visualization:

Although the model's goodness of fit improved slightly (adjusted R² = 4.4%), and the residual standard error (7.857) showed minor improvement, these findings suggest that while the model captures some complexity, accident count is still heavily influenced by other unmodeled factors.

However, it is important to note some uncertainty in our estimates and conclusions. On one hand, while the coefficients are statistically significant, the model's fit remains low, indicating that these variables explain only a small portion of the variation in accident count. On the other hand, the scattered data distribution may make the results particularly sensitive to extreme values or low-frequency categories, which can affect the magnitude and direction of coefficients. Furthermore, the nonlinear relationship between PCI and accident count, such as the U-shaped or inverted U-shaped trend, might depend on sample characteristics and data distribution, requiring further validation and analysis to draw more reliable conclusions.


Flaws and Limitations of the Analysis

When analyzing the relationship between PCI (Pavement Condition Index) and accident count, it is important to consider certain assumptions and data limitations. The current model assumes a simple linear or nonlinear relationship between PCI and accident count, but the actual situation may be more complex. Additionally, accident counts may be influenced by temporal or spatial factors.

The model's fit is not ideal, indicating that other significant factors (such as traffic volume, speed limits, or time of day) might have a greater impact on accident count. Moreover, the data distribution is quite dispersed, and some extreme values or low-frequency categories could significantly affect the results.

In the future, incorporating additional variables and improving the model structure (e.g., accounting for temporal or spatial factors) could enhance the analysis and provide a more accurate understanding.
